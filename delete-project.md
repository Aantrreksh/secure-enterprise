# Deleting a project
{: #delete-project}

You can delete a project at any time. Before you delete a project, you must delete the configurations within the project to avoid additional costs.

To delete a project, complete the following steps:

1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console, click the **Navigation menu** icon ![Navigation Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Projects**.
2. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg "Actions") > **Delete**.
3. Enter the project name into the required field.
    Make sure that you want to delete a project because after you delete a project the action can't be undone.
