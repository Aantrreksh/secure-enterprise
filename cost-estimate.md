# Estimating architecture costs in a project
{: #cost-estimate-project}

Cost estimation is available for deployable architectures in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Depending on the deployable architecture, a starting cost is estimated based on the available data. This estimate is meant to be a starting point to help you determine how much your account could be charged for deploying an architecture. This estimated amount is subject to change as the architecture is customized within a project, and it does not include all resources, usage, licenses, fees, discounts, or taxes.

## Viewing the starting cost for your deployable architecture
{: #cost-deploy-arch}

Depending on the deployable architecture that you select from the catalog, there is an estimated starting cost.

To view the estimated starting cost, complete the following steps:
1. Go to the catalog details page for the deployable architecture.
2. Next, click the **Starting at** amount for additional details about the cost summary.

After you add the deployable architecture to your project, you can configure the input values. By doing so, you can tailor the architecture to match your needs. Adjusting the configuration input might adjust the estimated cost.

1. Go to the **Projects** page, and select a project.
1. Go to **Configurations**, and select a configuration of the deployable architecture.
1. Enter the input values to configure the deployable architecture, and click **Save**. For more information about configuring and deploying, see [Configuring and deploying a deployable architecture](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-project).
1. After saving, the validation checks are run and a new cost estimate is computed. This might take a few minutes. After the validation is complete, you can view the estimated cost for the configured architecture on the validation modal in the **Cost estimate successful** section.

This estimated amount is subject to change as the architecture is customized and deployed, and it does not include all resources, usage, licenses, fees, discounts, or taxes.
