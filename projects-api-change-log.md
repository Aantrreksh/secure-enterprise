# Projects API change log
{: #projects-api-change-log}

In this change log, you can learn about the latest changes, improvements, and updates for the [Projects API](/apidocs/projects). The change log lists changes that have been made, ordered by the date they were released. Changes to existing API versions are designed to be compatible with existing client applications.



## 03 April 2024
{: #03-apr-2024}

Projects API v1.0.0 is now available. Make sure you update your version from beta.

The following changes impact the pagination of `list` operations. For more information, see the [pagination](/apidocs/projects#get-config-version-response) section of the Projects API docs.

### list-projects
{: #change-log-list-projects}

`GET /v1/projects`
* The page token query parameter was renamed from `start` to `token`.
  * For example, calling the `list-projects` operation changed from `GET /v1/projects?limit=5&start={page_token}` to `GET /v1/projects?limit=5&token={page_token}`.
* The first page is returned without the token query parameter in the request URL. For example, `GET /v1/projects?limit=5` OR `GET /v1/projects`.
  * The first page is also returned when the specified page token is invalid.
* The `last` and `previous` fields are no longer supported, nor included in the response payload.

### list-configs
{: #change-log-list-configs}

`GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs`
* This operation is now paginated.
* A default of 10 records is returned if the page size is not specified in the `limit` query parameter.
    * The maximum page size is of 100 records.
* The first page is returned without the token query parameter in the request URL. For example, `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/?limit=5` OR `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs`.
  * The first page is also returned when the specified page token is invalid.

### list-environments
{: #change-log-list-environments}

`GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/environments`
* This operation is now paginated.
* A default of 10 records are returned if the page size is not specified in the `limit` query parameter.
    * The maximum page size is of 100 records.
* The first page is returned without the `token` query parameter in the request URL. For example, `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/environments/?limit=5` OR `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/environments`.
  * The first page is also returned when the specified page token is invalid.

### Methods to support stacking deployable architectures
{: #change-log-stack-architectures}

[Experimental]{: tag-purple}

Added experimental methods to support [stacking deployable architectures](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack&interface=cli).

## 06 November 2023
{: #06-nov-2023}

The latest update includes the following breaking change:
* The `configurations` `response` models for all methods no longer use a `pipeline_state`. All status information of a `configuration` is available in the augmented `state` property in the canonical schema of a `configuration`.

### Projects and configurations changes
{: #projects-and-configs}

`create-project: POST /v1/projects`
* The `resource_group` and `location` are now to be embedded in the `request` payload. They are no longer supported as query parameters.

`delete-config: PATCH /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}`
* The `draft_only` query parameter is deprecated.
* The API now supports delete of `configuration` of a specified project ID and `version`. See [projects#delete-config-version](/apidocs/projects#delete-config-version).

### Renamed configuration endpoints
{: #renamed-config-endpoints}

The following configuration endpoints are renamed as follows:
* `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/check` is changed to `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/validate`.
* `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/install` is changed to `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/deploy`.
* `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/uninstall` is changed to `POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/undeploy`.

### Replaced configuration endpoints
{: #replaced-config-endpoints}

The `drafts` methods were replaced by the `versions` operations as follows:
* `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{config_id}/drafts` is changed to `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/versions`.
* `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{config_id}/drafts/{version}` is changed to `GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}/versions/{version}`

### Configuration states
{: #config-states}

The state model for `configurations` is flattened. The `pipeline_state` is no longer available, and the one `state` property is now augmented to capture all possible statuses of a `configuration`.

The following are the new `state` values:
* `approved`
* `deleted`
* `deleting`
* `deleting_failed`
* `discarded`
* `deployed`
* `deploying_failed`
* `deploying`
* `superceded`
* `undeploying`
* `undeploying_failed`
* `validated`
* `validating`
* `validating_failed`

All `configuration` endpoints include this `state` property in the `response` model. For an example, see [projects#get-config-version-response](/apidocs/projects#get-config-version-response).

### Configuration new metadata
{: #config-new-metadata}

The `response` model of `configurations` operations now defines new metadata in the root. If an `approve` job was run on a `configuration`, an `approved_version` property is included in the `response` payload. Similarly, if a `deploy` job was run on a `configuration`, then `deployed_version` and `last_deployed` metadata are available in the `response` body. Running a `validation` job yields the metadata `last_validated`, while running an `undeploy` job yields the metadata `last_undeployed` in the `response`.

## 25 October 2023
{: #25-oct-2023}

In `projects` and `configurations` operations, such as `create` and `update`, definition properties such as `name` and `description` must now be provided in a `definition` wrapper. Similarly, these properties are now only available inside a `definition` block in the `response` payload of `create`, `update`, `get`, and `list` operations. This is a breaking change that was originally released on 06 July 2023. The following sections provide more information about the methods that are affected by this update.

### Projects
{: #projects}

`create-project: POST /v1/projects`
* For both the `request` & `response`, the `name`, `description`, and `destroy_on_delete` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
* Callers of this endpoint are now expected to supply the definition properties inside this wrapper, for example:
    * `definition: {“name”: “test”, “description”: “This is a test project”, “destroy_on_delete”: false}`.
        * If `destroy_on_delete` is not provided, a default value of `true` is assigned on a project create operation.
    * See [projects#create-project-request](/apidocs/projects#create-project-request).
* Similarly, in the `response` body, the previously mentioned properties are now available in a `definition` block.
    * See [projects#create-project-response](/apidocs/projects#create-project-response).

`update-project: PATCH /v1/projects/{id}`
* For both the `request` & `response`, the `name`, `description`, and `destroy_on_delete` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
* Callers of this endpoint are now expected to supply the definition properties inside this wrapper, for example:
    * `definition: {“name”: “test_update”, “description”: “This is an updated test project“}`.
    * See [projects#update-project-request](/apidocs/projects#update-project-request).
* Similarly, in the `response` body, the previously mentioned properties are now available in a `definition` block.
    * See [projects#update-project-response](/apidocs/projects#update-project-response).

`get-projects: GET /v1/projects/{id}`
* In the `response` of this operation, the `name`, `description`, and `destroy_on_delete` are now wrapped inside a `definition` block.
    * See [projects#get-project-response](/apidocs/projects#get-project-response).

`list-project: GET /v1/projects`
* Each project that is returned in the `response` array wraps the `name`, `description`, and `destroy_on_delete` properties in a `definition` block.
    * See [projects#list-projects-response](/apidocs/projects#list-projects-response).

### Configurations
{: #configurations}

`create-config: POST /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs`
* For both `request` & `response`, the `locator_id`, `name`, `labels`, `authorizations`, `compliance_profile`, `input`, `setting`, `description` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
* Callers of this endpoint are now expected to supply the definition properties inside this wrapper, for example:
    * `definition: {“name”: “test”, “description”: “This is a test config”, “locator_id”: “1082e7d2-5e2f-0a11-a3bc-f88a8e1931fc.cd596f95-95a2-4f21-9b84-477f21fd1e95-global”}`.
    * See [projects#create-config-request](/apidocs/projects#create-config-request).
* Similarly, in the `response` body, the previously mentioned properties are now available in a `definition` block.
    * A `setting` property is also included in the `definition` block.
    * See [projects#create-config-response](/apidocs/projects#create-config-response).

`update-config: PATCH /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs/{id}`
* For both `request` & `response`, the `locator_id`, `name`, `labels`, `authorizations`, `compliance_profile`, `input`, `setting`, `description` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
* Callers of this endpoint are now expected to supply the definition properties inside this wrapper, for example:
    * `definition: {“name”: “test”, “description”: “This is a test config”, “locator_id”: “1082e7d2-5e2f-0a11-a3bc-f88a8e1931fc.cd596f95-95a2-4f21-9b84-477f21fd1e95-global”}`.
    * See [projects#update-config-request](/apidocs/projects#update-config-request).
* Similarly, in the `response` body the previously mentioned properties are moved into a `definition` block.
    * See [projects#update-config-response](/apidocs/projects#update-config-response).

`get-config: GET /v1/projects/{id}`
* In the `response` of this operation, the `locator_id`, `name`, `labels`, `authorizations`, `compliance_profile`, `input`, `setting`, `description`, and `setting` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
    * See [projects#get-config-response](/apidocs/projects#get-config-response).

`list-configs: GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/configs`
* In the `response` of this operation, the `name` and `description` are now wrapped inside a `definition` object.
    * See [projects#list-configs-response](/apidocs/projects#list-configs-response).

## 06 July 2023
{: #06-jul-2023}

The response models for all methods now enforce a lower snake case format in `state` values. This format is to be expected in the response when you are calling the project and configuration endpoints. This update is a breaking change.
{: important}

Project `state` values can now be `ready`, `deleting`, and `deleting_failed`. For an example, see [the response schema for the `update-project` method](/apidocs/projects#update-project).

Configuration `state` values can now be `deleted`, `deleting`, `deleting_failed`, `installed`, `installed_failed`, `installing`, `not_installed`, `uninstalling`, `uninstalling_failed`, and `active`. For an example, see [the response schema for the `get-config` method](/apidocs/projects#get-config).
