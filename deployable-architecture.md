# What are deployable architectures?
{: #what-are-deployable-architectures}

Creating secure, compliant, and scalable application infrastructure can be difficult to set up and costly to maintain. Instead of figuring out how to assemble a compliant infrastructure architecture on your own, you can review the deployable architectures that are available in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/catalog#reference_architecture). Each architecture can be configured to your needs or used as a starting point for your organization's internal library of automation.
{: shortdesc}

Think about an architect who is building a house by using patterns in a modular way, for example, a standard kitchen interior, bathroom layout, and bedroom layout that fit together to create a functional space. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} applied this same analogy to deploying solutions on the cloud. Instead of your organization spending months architecting the services and software that work together, you can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}'s well-architected patterns that are packaged as composable, automated building blocks. With the building blocks, you can start with smaller pieces and add on to them over time with automation.

A deployable architecture is cloud automation for deploying a common architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources, and it is designed for easier deployment, scalability, and modularity. Each deployable architecture is built and maintained by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} experts and follows {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} best practices. They remove the guesswork from the architecture design process and reduce the time that it takes to deploy complex reference patterns that are secure by default for regulated industries like financial services.

Similar to ordinary commercial software, you donâ€™t need to be an expert in networking, security, or automation to use deployable architectures. However, unlike software where you are typically done after you install, deployable architectures can be extended, customized, and built out by multiple teams layering automation to build a robust enterprise-grade cloud solution.

You can take advantage of automated deployments and built-in lifecycle management tools to seamlessly deploy to different environments, reduce deployment times, and manage deployments over time in a well-architected version-controlled way. By using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployable architectures, [projects](#x2035151){: term}, and other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} tools, you can use automated building blocks to seamlessly deploy to your different environments and monitor and manage the lifecycle and compliance.


## Customizing architectures to your business or compliance goals
{: #business-goals}

Whether you're deploying by using lifecycle management tools with projects, installing with the CLI to locally test, downloading the code to extend and customize it to your needs, or taking the deployable architecture as-is from the catalog, you can use the architecture patterns to help you get up and running faster in the cloud.

Many of the deployable architectures have different options, called variations, available for you to compare and choose from in the catalog. For example, a quick start variation can help you create a proof of concept to start at a reduced cost. And with each available option in the catalog, you can compare details such as the architecture diagram, claimed compliance information, features and highlights, and the starting at cost.

Depending on your needs, you might want to use customization options such as turning off various features of the architecture pattern or hardcoding specific variables for your organization's use. You can customize by downloading a customization bundle of the deployable architecture code, updating the Terraform, and onboarding that version of the deployable architecture to a private catalog for your enterprise's use.


## Managing the lifecycle of your deployable architecture
{: #deploy-arch-lifecycle}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you can standardize application infrastructure where possible and then host many applications on the same infrastructure to reduce operations costs by using deployable architectures and [projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects).

While multiple options exist for working with deployable architectures, {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} projects provide built-in DevOps lifecycle management for working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments that can be used across accounts. Each project has tools built-in to scan for potentially harmful resource changes, compliance, security, and cost, as well as tracking for versioning and governance. Learn more about [working with projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects).

## Ensuring and maintaining compliance of deployable architectures
{: #deploy-arch-compliance}

In addition to assembling the pieces of the architecture for you, many of the deployable architectures available in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog are built with security and compliance by default principles. From the start, deployable architectures take preventive measures by adding in compliance controls that must be met by default. When you deploy the architecture, you can monitor and validate against the controls that evolve over time to ensure that your workloads are compliant and your organization is audit-ready.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides clear compliance information for each available deployable architecture so that you can understand how each deployable architecture can meet your security and compliance requirements during the evaluation phase. You can review the compliance details from the catalog and even customize the deployable architecture to include and validate against additional compliance or regulatory standards that your organization needs. With the Security and Compliance Center, you can use predefined compliance profiles or create custom profiles that scan against all of the resources deployed in your accounts.

## Getting started with deployable architectures
{: #get-started-deployable-arch}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can help reduce the time that it takes to design the right solutions that meet all of the intricate compliance controls and regulations for your industry. Go to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](/catalog#reference_architecture) to review the available deployable architectures to identify the patterns that can work for your business. Whether it's taking a deployable architecture as-is, configuring it to your needs in a project, or downloading the code directly from the catalog to customize or extend it to fit your needs exactly, we can help jump-start your move to running secure workloads on the cloud.
